## Introduction
The Photo-Translate uses the text recognition and translation functions of HUAWEI ML Kit to translate text in static photos into the required language. Currently, the following languages are supported: Simplified Chinese, English, French, Arabic, Thai, Spanish, Turkish, Portuguese, Japanese, German, Italian, and Russian.

This demo demonstrates how to quickly develop photo translate function in your app using [HUAWEI ML Kit](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/hms/huawei-mlkit).

The goal is to let you experience text recognition and translation function and help you integrate HUAWEI ML Kit as quickly as possible.
